# Screenshoter

There's three important files to make the program work:

Screenshoter Save.exe:
Opens a GUI that allows the user to insert the absolute path for the screenshot

diretorio.txt:
An text file that will store the path assigned by the user

Screenshoter.exe:
The main file that takes the screenshot


# How to use?

First you need to open the Screenshoter Save.exe file for the first time and select a folder (the path) for the .png file. After that you won't need to open this file ever again, only if you want to change the directory

The next thing you'll want to do is to make the Screenshoter.exe file start with your OS
so you won't need to open every time*

Finally to make it work you need to press the left ALT key and then ALT Gr simultaneously - like a phone printscreen :)

**For being a low privilege application it won't normally work with some other apps, specially games, unless 
you open the Screenshoter.exe as admin.*
